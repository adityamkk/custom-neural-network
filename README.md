# Custom Neural Network

## Description

The project is a website where users can customize a neural network's layers, size, and activations to perform simple classification algorithms, such as XOR Gates, Inverters, contrast algorithms, and more.

### Features

Iterations: Specify the number of iterations the model makes through the data provided (default = 10,000)
Learning Rate: Specify the rate at which the model learns (default = 0.4)
Number of Layers: Specify the number of layers in the model, as well as the size and activation of each layer

Amount of Data: Specify the number of data points are provided to the model

Predict: After training, the model will make a prediction based on the input to the model.
